# AUTOSAR-Software-Design-based-on-ARM-for-CAN-Bus-Networking-System
Implemented a CAN bus system that allows centralized control over ECUs that are connected to the network so that controlling ECUs becomes easy using Arm Cortex M4 Tiva C board as microcontroller. The first ECU functions as main ECU to control the output state of other ECUs by sending a command on the CAN network based on the on-board switchesâ€™ states. Other ECUs receive the commands sent on the bus and execute them using output LEDs. All ECUs are restricted with specific timing constraints during their functionality. More over, this was applied by the AUTOSAR to standardize the software architecture of ECUs, improve complexity management of integrated E/E architectures, facilitate portability, composability, integration of SW components.
